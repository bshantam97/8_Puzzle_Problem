# 8_Puzzle_Problem

This repository contains the code I developed to solve the 8 Puzzle problem using Breadth first search. Below is the method through which you can run the code on your native machine. Below the instructions are provided for implementation on a linux based system


## Standard install via command line

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bshantam97/8_Puzzle_Problem.git 
```
## Command to run the program
```

```
The matrix values will be entered in the row format, for example in the above command 123 denotes the first row of the puzzle, 560 denotes the second row of the puzzle and 847 denotes the third row of the puzzle. 0 indicates a blank tile.
